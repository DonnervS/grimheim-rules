# Grimheim Skirmish Game

Grimheim is a fast-paced, miniature-agnostic skirmish game set in a classic grimdark fantasy world. It features modern rules that keep both players engaged with minimal downtime. This repository contains the open-source rules for Grimheim, organized for easy reading and use in both GitHub and Obsidian.

**Game Highlights:**

- **Handful of Miniatures:** Control small warbands – every model’s actions are crucial.
- **Miniature Agnostic:** Use any miniatures you like – no specific models required.
- **Fast-Paced & Dynamic:** Alternate model activations keep both players constantly involved.
- **Easy Setup:** All you need are a few six-sided dice (D6), a ruler (inches), and your models. No special tokens or boards required.
- **Customizable Warbands:** Build warbands with near-total freedom in composition.
- **Heroic Battles:** Models are resilient, leading to intense and strategic combats.
- **Free & Open-Source:** The rules are freely available and community-driven. Optional tools (printable cards, apps) can assist gameplay.
