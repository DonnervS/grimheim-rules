Grimheim features multiple factions, each with its own flavor, strengths, and unique options. Faction choice affects what **Fate Modifiers** and **Arcane Lores** you can use, and sometimes provides access to special rules or equipment unique to that faction. All factions (except Mercenaries) have a base cost of 0 for choosing them – they balance each other out with pros/cons rather than point costs.

Below is an overview of the core factions:

## Imperial 
The **Imperium** of Sol Invictus is a human-dominated faction, defined by discipline, faith in the Unconquered Sun, and combined arms. Imperial warbands are versatile and well-rounded.

- **Fate Modifiers:** Imperial warbands may use the **Common Fate** table, or the unique **Imperial Fate** (typically a 10-point fate modifier focused on discipline), and an advanced modifier called **Divine Judgment** (15 pts) which grants powerful bonuses like extra attacks for the faithful and cleanses of status effects. *(Imperial Fate emphasizes balanced boosts; Divine Judgment provides strong holy benefits.)*
- **Arcane Lore:** Imperials can access **Elemental Magic** and **Divine Blessing** lores (in addition to Lesser Magic). Elemental Magic gives them control over fire, earth, etc., while Divine Blessings are miracle-like spells from the cult of Sol.
- **Unique Units/Rules:** Imperial forces include well-trained soldiers (swordsmen, musketeers), witch hunters, and even inquisitors. For example, Imperial Witch Hunters are **Fearless** and have access to holy firearms and **Versatile Quiver** (their archers can apply special arrow effects at a cost of accuracy). 
- **Playstyle:** Balanced – a mix of melee, shooting, and a touch of magic/prayers. They have decent armor and leadership.

## Undead 
The **Undead** legions are reanimated corpses, vengeful spirits, and deathless knights bound by dark sorcery.

- **Fate Modifiers:** Undead warbands have their own fate tables such as **Sons of the Eternal King** (around 20 pts) focusing on reanimation and vengeance. They also can use the Common Fate (if mixed) but usually stick to their necromantic themes. Undead fate modifiers often allow models to rise again after being defeated or curse the living.
- **Arcane Lore:** Likely **Necromancy** or death magic is available (if not explicitly given in this version, assume they have Lesser Magic or a custom lore of reanimation). Undead priests might use unholy prayers.
- **Unique Units/Rules:** Undead models often have **Resilient** (some ignore injuries or don’t die easily) and **Fearless** (they have no morale). Typical undead include skeleton warriors, zombies (with **Necrotic Hunger** perhaps meaning they heal by killing), wights, and vampires. They may suffer from **Slow** movement but make up for it with resilience or sheer numbers.
- **Playstyle:** Attrition – they tend to come back from the grave, overwhelm with numbers, and debilitate the enemy with curses and fear. Not very fast, but hard to put down permanently.

## Primordial 
The **Primordial** faction represents chaos hordes, demonic entities, and cults devoted to chaos gods. They are volatile and powerful.

- **Fate Modifiers:** Primordial warbands have high-impact fate modifiers, often with a risk. For example, **Tides of Chaos** (standard 40 pt fate modifier) lets them alter dice rolls (change values), **Bloodforged**, **Rotborn**, **Veilweavers**, **Scions of Excess** are sub-faction fate sets (~30 pts each) corresponding to different chaos aspects. These can grant things like extra attacks at the cost of self-inflicted wounds, causing fear and madness in enemies, summoning additional fate dice, etc.
- **Arcane Lore:** They likely access **Dark Magic** or chaos lores. They can also use Lesser Magic. Their priests/shamans might have unique chaos rituals.
- **Unique Units/Rules:** Many Primordial units are monstrous or mutated. They might have higher base stats but with unpredictability. Special rules like **Enraged** or self-damaging abilities are common. For instance, a berserker demon might have an aura causing Fearful status (Aura of Fear) to enemies but also harm itself for extra power (as hinted by fate modifiers like Dark Bargain).
- **Playstyle:** High risk, high reward – Primordial forces hit hard and can use bizarre effects (plagues, mutations, mind control), but sometimes hurt themselves or have less armor. They can field demons that are extremely deadly in melee and wield chaos magic.

## Tribes 
The **Tribes** encompass various savage races and wild folk: orcs, goblins, beastmen, even ratmen (vermin) and other clans.

- **Fate Modifiers:** Tribal warbands break down into subcultures. For example, **Orks** (10 pt fate mod) grant brute force bonuses like extra attack dice, **Night Goblins** (20 pt fate mod) allow tricks like backstabbing and fungal rebirth (bringing back a fallen goblin with a poison bonus), **Vermin** (30 pt fate mod) might allow stealth movement (“In the Shadows”) and spreading disease (“Plague”). All Tribes fate mods generally encourage aggressive play and group tactics (like Stampede or Mass Brawl letting multiple activations).
- **Arcane Lore:** Tribes might rely less on formal magic; some sub-factions might have shamans with Lesser Magic or unique lores (e.g., Goblin Shamans with fungus magic, or Beastmen shamans). Likely they default to Lesser Magic if they take any.
- **Unique Units/Rules:** Orcs are typically strong and tough, possibly with **Furious** (like Savage Orcs can fight twice). Goblins are weaker individually but cheap and can come in groups (**Group** special rule) and use trickery (**Backstab** gives extra attacks when ganging up). Ratmen (skaven analog) are **Swift** and cunning, possibly with poison and strange devices. A special unit, the **Gnasher** (squig-like creature), is essentially a living ball of fangs classified as a Creature, often handled in groups with goblin handlers.
- **Playstyle:** Horde and rush. Tribes rely on numbers, ferocity, and sneaky tactics. They have fewer heavy armors but can swarm enemies and have some unique tricks (like exploding mushrooms or brute strength maneuvers). They generally have low discipline but high aggression.

## Elven Kingdoms 
The **Elven Kingdoms** are ancient realms of elves known for grace, magic, and skilled archery.

- **Fate Modifiers:** Elves likely have fate mods enhancing finesse: e.g., an **Elven Highborn** fate set might improve dice pools for movement and archery, or grant rerolls (elven foresight). (Not explicitly given in text, but one can imagine an “Elven Fate” table around 10–15 pts focusing on precision and agility).
- **Arcane Lore:** Elves have access to powerful magic. They certainly can use Lesser Magic, and probably a unique lore of **Elemental Magic** or **High Magic**. They may also access **Divine** if they have clerics.
- **Unique Units/Rules:** Elves are usually **Swift** (fast MOV), with high accuracy. They might have slightly lower WND than humans but better SAV (due to grace or light armor). Common special rules: **Marksman/Hunter** (some bonus to shooting), maybe **Versatile Quiver** is actually an Elven-origin ability allowing them to apply special effects to arrows (though in the book it’s listed for Imperial as faction-specific). Elven bladesmen could have **Parry** abilities, and elites might have **Heroic** traits.
- **Playstyle:** Elite and tactical. Elves have fewer models, but each is skilled. Expect excellent ranged attacks and strong magic, using maneuverability to avoid slugfests. They might not have the heavy armor of dwarves or the numbers of tribes, but excel at picking apart foes with superior skill.

## Dwarven Holds 
The **Dwarven Holds** are the fortress-cities of the dwarves, known for sturdy warriors, craftsmanship, and resilience.

- **Fate Modifiers:** Dwarves might have fate mods emphasizing defense and counterattack. Possibly a **Standard (Dwarven)** fate (maybe around 10 pts) that boosts armor or allows extra defense dice, etc. They may also have a special fate set reflecting their engineering or grudges (e.g., something that gives bonus damage against a target that wounded a dwarf).
- **Arcane Lore:** Dwarves are not typically big spellcasters; however, they might have **Rune Magic** or blessings of the forge. In absence of a unique lore, they likely stick to Lesser Magic or none at all except maybe a Priest of stone or so.
- **Unique Units/Rules:** Dwarves are generally **Slow** (MOV 3″ in the profile) but **Hardened** (perhaps better base SAV or extra armor). They commonly wear **Medium or Heavy Armor**, giving them extra block dice. Many dwarf units might have innate **Tough** or **Resilient** making them hard to kill. They also have specialists like engineers with guns, or berserkers (who might ignore defense for high offense).
- **Playstyle:** Defensive and steadfast. Dwarven warbands move slowly but are difficult to dislodge. They excel in holding objectives and withstanding charges, then hitting back with guns or axes. They often have reliable armor saves and might bring contraptions (like small cannons or flamethrowers) for area control.

## Mercenaries 
**Mercenaries** are not a single faction per se, but a mix-and-match option. If you choose Mercenaries, you can include models from multiple factions together.

- **Cost:** Mercenary warbands pay a surcharge of +5 points **per model** for the flexibility of mixing factions.
- **Restrictions:** Mercenaries cannot use any faction-specific Fate Modifiers or faction-specific Arcane Lores. They are limited to the generic **Common Fate** table and **Lesser Magic** lore.
- **Advantages:** You can cherry-pick units: an elf archer, a dwarf warrior, a human knight all fighting in one team, for example. This allows unique combinations that normal faction warbands can’t have.
- **Playstyle:** Highly customizable. Mercenaries let you fill any gaps in your strategy by hiring from all over Grimheim. However, without a faction’s specialized fate powers or cohesive theme, they rely on the raw abilities of their diverse troops (and three generic fate dice).

---

Each faction may have additional special rules or units described in their specific list. The above is a summary to guide your expectations:

- **Imperial:** Balanced combined-arms, strong leadership.
- **Undead:** Persistent, fear-inducing, can resurrect.
- **Primordial (Chaos):** Powerful but unpredictable, many sub-faction choices.
- **Tribes:** Massed assaults by orcs, goblins, beastfolk with cunning tricks.
- **Elves:** Elite, fast, magical archers and duelists.
- **Dwarves:** Tough, slow, heavily armored and mechanically savvy.
- **Mercenaries:** Mix of anything, with a premium cost.

When building your warband, first decide the faction to set the tone, then use the faction’s available Fate Modifiers and Arcane Lore to your advantage. Each faction’s flavor can be further explored with its premade warbands and narrative background, which add depth to Grimheim’s world.
