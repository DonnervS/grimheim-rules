This reference provides the details for constructing and understanding individual characters (models) in Grimheim. It covers base **Body Types**, **Tier** upgrades, **Armor** types, and other notes about defining a model (Classes and Special Rules limits).

Creating a model involves choosing each of these aspects and totaling the point cost.

## Body Types

Body Type determines a model’s base physical stats (Action Points, Movement, Defense, Wounds) and sometimes innate special rules. Some body types are available only to specific factions (as noted).

| Body Type       | AP | MOV  | DEF | WND | Special Rules         | Points |
|-----------------|----|------|-----|-----|-----------------------|--------|
| Human           | 2  | 4″   | 3   | 10  | –                     | 35     |
| Human Brute     | 2  | 4″   | 4   | 12  | **Tough**             | 63     |
| Halfling        | 2  | 4″   | 3   | 8   | **Slow**              | ~24    |
| Dwarf *(Holds)* | 2  | 3″   | 4   | 12  | **Slow, Hardened**    | ~50    |
| Elf *(Kingdom)* | 2  | 4″   | 3   | 9   | –                     | ~30    |
| Canine (Warhound)|2 | 5″   | 2   | 8   | **Group, Creature**   | 31     |
| Ratman *(Vermin)*|2 | 4″   | 3   | 9   | **Swift**             | ~28    |
| Night Goblin    | 2  | 4″   | 3   | 8   | –                     | ~20    |
| Orc             | 2  | 4″   | 4   | 12  | –                     | ~40    |
| Savage Orc      | 2  | 4″   | 4   | 12  | **Furious**           | ~45    |
| Zombie *(Undead)* |2| 3″   | 3   | 10? | **Resilient, Slow, Group, Necrotic Hunger** | ~30 |
| Skeleton *(Undead)*|2| 3″ | 3   | 10? | **Resilient**         | ~30    |
| Gnasher *(Creature)* | – | – | – | –  | **Creature**          | (varies) |

*Points marked with "~" are estimates based on incomplete data; actual costs are determined by faction lists. Some special rules are inherent and already factored into cost (e.g., Slow gives a discount, Tough and others add cost).*

**Faction-specific Availability:** Certain body types are only usable by certain factions. For example, “Night Goblin” and “Orc” body types are for Tribes (greenskin) faction only. “Zombie” and “Skeleton” are for Undead faction, etc. Mercenaries may hire from any faction’s types but still pay the +5 points per model mercenary tax.

## Tier (Model Level)

Tier represents the experience or significance of a model. Higher tier models have improved stats and special roles (Leader/Hero). You may apply at most one of each tier type to a model, and some can stack (e.g., a model could be both a Hero and a Veteran).

- **Leader** (+55 pts): The model is the warband leader. *Max 1 per warband.* Gains **+1 maximum AP**, **+10 WND**, and the **Leader** special rule. (Leader usually provides command benefits like the **Command** action which grants other models AP.) This is typically stacked on an already strong model.
- **Hero** (+28 pts): A notable hero or champion. *Max 2 per warband.* Gains **+1 maximum AP**, **+5 WND**, and the **Hero** special rule. Heroes are slightly tougher and can often perform special feats or have access to better gear.
- **Veteran** (+20 pts): A seasoned warrior. *Max 5 per warband.* Gains **+2 WND** and the **Veteran** special rule (usually a minor perk, like re-rolling one dice once per game or immunity to fear, etc., depending on context). Veterans have no AP bonus, but their extra wounds make them more survivable.
- **Standard** (+0 pts): The model has no special tier. This is the default for rank-and-file troops with no stat bonuses.

**Stacking Tiers:** You can combine tier upgrades on a single model if allowed by warband limits. For instance, you might make one model both a **Hero and a Veteran** (paying +28 +20 = +48 pts) – that model would get +1 AP, +5 +2 = +7 WND, and both Hero and Veteran special rules. A Leader could also be made a Veteran for even more WND. However, you cannot have more than the allowed number of each type across the whole warband.

Tiers let you create a hierarchy: one Leader, a couple of Heroes, a few Veterans, and the rest standard troops. This adds depth and differentiation to your warband’s characters.

## Armor

Armor determines a model’s **SAV** (Save target number) and can grant extra defensive special rules. Choose one armor type per model:

| Armor       | Type         | Save | Special Rule    | Points |
|-------------|--------------|------|-----------------|--------|
| None        | No Armor     | 6+   | –               | 0      |
| Robes       | Light Armor  | 5+   | –               | 8      |
| Leather     | Light Armor  | 5+   | –               | 8      |
| Great Coat  | Light Armor  | 5+   | –               | 8      |
| Brigandine  | Medium Armor | 4+   | **Medium Armor** | 16    |
| Chainmail   | Medium Armor | 4+   | **Medium Armor** | 16    |
| Scale Armor | Medium Armor | 4+   | **Medium Armor** | 16    |
| Full Plate  | Heavy Armor  | 3+   | **Heavy Armor**  | 32    |

- **Light Armor (5+ save):** Examples include padded robes, leather jerkins, etc. No special rule beyond improving save.
- **Medium Armor (4+ save):** Includes brigandine, chain, scale. Medium Armor grants the model **+1 Block Die** in close combat. (That is, when in melee, roll an extra defense die that only counts for blocking melee hits.) This extra die uses the model’s normal SAV (4+ in this case) and a roll of 6 on it counts as a critical save.
- **Heavy Armor (3+ save):** Includes full plate armor. Heavy Armor grants **+2 Block Dice** in close combat (two extra defense dice for melee). These also use the model’s SAV (3+ saves, making the model extremely hard to hurt in melee). Heavy armor makes the model quite slow typically, but that’s reflected in the body’s Slow rule if applicable (e.g., dwarves in heavy armor).

Choose armor based on the role: lightly armored units are faster and cheaper, heavily armored ones are costly but very durable, especially in melee.

*(Note: A model’s base SAV might be modified by other factors too; armor sets the base. Some special rules or injuries can adjust the save value.)*

## Class and Special Rules

Grimheim does not use rigid “classes” like fighter, mage, rogue – instead, you define a model’s **role (class)** by the special rules you give it and the equipment it carries. For example, giving a model the **Arcane** special rule and a Magic Lore makes it effectively a “Wizard.” Giving a model high combat stats, **Furious**, and a big axe makes it a “Berserker.”

**Adding Special Rules:** You may add up to 5 special rules to a model (including those from body type, tier, etc.). Each special rule has a point cost (see the Special Rules reference). Some special rules are restricted (e.g., faction-specific ones or ones that wouldn’t make sense together).

**Examples:**
- If you want a sneaky rogue character, you might take a Human (35 pts), give them **Ambush** (4 pts) and **Dual Wield** (5 pts) with two daggers, maybe **Backstab** if available to Tribes or a similar rule to get bonus when flanking.
- For a holy priest, take Arcane or Priest (Arcane 25 pts or if there is a Priest rule), give them minimal armor, and maybe **Heal** as a special action via gear or spell.

**Leader and Hero Special Rules:** Note that “Leader,” “Hero,” etc., from Tiers count towards the 5-rule limit. These usually grant certain in-game benefits beyond stat boosts (for example, a Leader might allow a **Command** action to give AP to allies).

**Special Rule Limit:** No model may exceed 5 special rules total. This is to prevent a single model from having too many stacked abilities. When designing a high-tier character, choose their key strengths and focus on those.

## Example of Building a Character

Suppose we create an **Imperial Captain** to lead a warband:
- Body Type: Human (AP 2, MOV 4, DEF 3, WND 10) – 35 pts.
- Tier: Leader (+1 AP, +10 WND, Leader rule) – +55 pts.
- Armor: Full Plate (3+ save, Heavy Armor rule) – +32 pts.
- Weapons: Sword and Shield (Sword 10 pts, Shield represented by Buckler rule 5 pts maybe).
- Special Rules: We’ve already got Leader. We might add **Buckler** for the shield (+5 pts), and perhaps **Fearless** (+5 pts) to represent his courage. That’s 2 special rules (Leader, Fearless; Buckler is technically equipment-based).
- Total: 35+55+32+10+5+5 = 142 pts. This Captain ends up with AP 3 (2+Leader bonus), WND 20 (10+Leader bonus), DEF 3, SAV 3+, and special rules: Leader (granting Command action, etc.), Fearless (immune to fear), Heavy Armor (+2 block dice in melee), and Buckler (+1 block die, easier blocks). He’s a tough, inspiring hero to anchor the warband.

## Managing Characters in Game

During play, remember which model has which special abilities. It can help to note them on a card or sheet. For example, mark which ones have Arcane (so they can cast spells), which have Group (so you activate them together), etc.

Characters gain experience or injuries in campaigns, which might alter their stats slightly (as noted under injuries in Combat and status effects). Outside of campaigns, each battle your characters start fresh at their listed stats.

Using this Characters reference alongside the Special Rules list and Weapons list, you have the tools to custom-build nearly any fantasy character concept within the Grimheim system. Enjoy the freedom to create your ideal warband members!
