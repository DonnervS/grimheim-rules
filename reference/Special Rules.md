Many models and weapons have **Special Rules** that grant them unique abilities or traits beyond the core rules. Special rules often come with a point cost (if taken on a model) or are inherent to certain equipment. This reference is divided into **Model Special Rules** (abilities that apply to models) and **Weapon Special Rules** (properties of weapons), as well as common **Status Effects** that can affect models during play.

Each special rule’s name is given with a brief description and the point cost (if applicable) in parentheses. A model can have at most **5 special rules** total (not counting temporary status effects).

## Model Special Rules

These rules can be purchased for models (if allowed) or might come built into certain body types, classes, or tier upgrades.

- **Ambush** *(4 pts)* – The model can be held in reserve instead of deploying normally. Starting from the second turn, you may deploy this model anywhere on the battlefield more than 9″ away from any enemy models. *(Great for setting up surprise attacks.)*
- **Arcane** *(25 pts)* – The model can perform the **Cast a Spell** special action (i.e., it’s a spellcaster, able to generate Magical Energy and cast spells, assuming your warband has an Arcane Lore chosen).
- **Archmage** *(18 pts)* – The model may use the **Cast a Spell** action multiple times in a single activation (instead of the normal once). In other words, this mage can cast several spells per turn if it has the AP and energy to do so.
- **Buckler** *(5 pts)* – The model carries a buckler or small shield. It rolls +1 additional die when defending in close combat. Also, when using this extra “block” die, rolls of 2+ on that die count as a successful block against a hit (instead of needing the full SAV value). A roll of 6 on the block die is still a critical save. *(This represents a buckler’s ability to easily knock aside blows, though it’s only effective in melee.)*
- **Furious** *(5 pts)* – The model’s rage propels it in combat. It may perform the **Fight** action twice per activation (normally, an action can only be used once per activation). This allows two separate melee attacks in one turn.
- **Gunslinger** *(8 pts)* – The model excels at close-range shooting. It can shoot with a pistol or similar sidearm even if it’s in melee range of enemies (normally, being in melee prevents shooting). This often is paired with carrying multiple pistols.
- **Hero** *(28 pts)* – This denotes a heroic individual. (This is usually acquired via Tier rather than chosen freely.) A Hero gets +1 max AP and +5 WND compared to a standard model, and has the **Hero** trait (often conferring bravery or other narrative effects). Limit 2 heroes per warband.
- **Leader** *(55 pts)* – This model is the warband’s leader. (Usually only one model can have this, via Tier upgrade.) A Leader gets +1 max AP and +10 WND, and gains the **Leader** trait. Leaders often provide a bonus or have unique actions like **Command** (allowing them to grant AP to others). Only 1 leader per warband.
- **Resilient** *(varies)* – The model is extremely hard to damage. This usually means it reduces incoming damage or has other defensive perks. (*In Grimheim, “Resilient” is often a faction trait: for Undead, it might indicate the model ignores certain injury effects or has no critical weak point. Exact effect should be described in faction rules. There may not be a point cost if it’s inherent to a faction’s models.*)
- **Slow** *(-2 pts)* – The model is slow-moving. It cannot use the **Run** action (so it’s limited to standard Move only). This disadvantage reduces the model’s cost.
- **Swift** *(3 pts)* – The model is unusually fast or agile. Increase its base Movement by some amount or simply note it has an easier time with movement-related rolls. (*If associated with Ratman for example, it likely means MOV is slightly higher than typical. Point cost 3 here is indicative that Swift is a minor benefit.*)
- **Tough** *(10 pts)* – The model can shrug off damage. It might have an additional wound or some chance to ignore wounds. (In Grimheim’s context, *Tough* typically means the model’s WND stat is higher than normal for its type – e.g., Human Brute has Tough giving it more Wounds. The cost reflects increased resilience.)
- **Creature** *(0 pts)* – A keyword indicating the model is a non-humanoid creature. This often has interactions with other rules (for example, certain spells or abilities might only affect creatures, or creatures might not capture objectives). It doesn’t have a direct cost.
- **Group** *(special)* – This rule allows multiple models to activate together. Models with **Group** can be activated at the same time (spending one model’s activation to move all in the group). Typically, two or more identical models (like a pair of Warhounds or a squad of weak troops) share the Group rule and activate simultaneously, acting as a single unit for movement and sometimes combat. Grouped models usually must stay near each other. (Point cost is built into those models; you don’t buy this separately.)
- **Fearless** *(5 pts)* – The model is immune to morale effects like **Fearful** status. It never suffers penalties from fear and will not flee due to terrifying enemies. (This often comes inherently with certain elite or undead models.)
- **Hardened** *(? pts)* – The model has thick skin or armor plating naturally. Hardened could mean it has a better base Save value or reduces damage. (Dwarves are noted as Slow and Hardened. Hardened might improve their save or give a small damage reduction. Since it’s tied to a race, no direct point buy, but it’s part of that race’s cost.)

*(There are many more model special rules in Grimheim; this list covers common ones found in the core rules. Faction-specific special rules are listed under those factions in the Factions reference.)*

## Weapon Special Rules

Weapon special rules describe properties of weapons that affect how they hit or what extra effects they have. These often apply automatically when using that weapon.

- **Ancient** *(6 pts)* – An ancient weapon of a bygone era. Once per combat, when this weapon misses (an unsuccessful hit roll), the attacker may re-roll one attack die. *(Essentially, the weapon has a chance to “try again” due to its superior craftsmanship or magical nature.)*
- **Armor Piercing** *(8 pts)* – Attacks with this weapon punch through armor. The defender’s **SAV** is worsened by 1 against this attack. For example, if a model has SAV 4+, an armor-piercing hit forces them to save on 5+ instead. (Critical saves are still only on a natural 6.)
- **Armor Shatter** *(10 pts)* – A particularly heavy blow that can wreck armor. If this weapon scores a critical hit on a target, the target’s armor is damaged: increase their SAV by +1 for the rest of the game (making all their future saves harder) as their armor is partially destroyed. This is in addition to dealing damage.
- **Blast** *(12 pts)* – The attack explodes on impact. When you hit the target, models near the target also risk getting hit. Generally, a “Blast (X”)” will specify a radius. For example, “Blast (2\")” means every model within 2″ of the initial target also takes a hit (usually one hit, not critical) from the explosion. They can attempt to defend as normal. Be careful: blast weapons can hit your own troops if they are too close.
- **Deadly** *(varies pts)* – A deadly weapon has enhanced critical effect. Often it means the weapon’s critical hits do extra fatal damage or cannot be saved normally. For instance, a **Deadly** weapon might inflict some **Fatal** damage on a critical in addition to normal damage. The exact nature depends on the weapon description.
- **Dual Wield** *(5 pts)* – (This is both a model and weapon trait.) If a model is armed with two one-handed weapons, it can dual-wield. Dual Wield grants an extra attack roll in combat with the off-hand weapon. In game terms, a model with Dual Wield can roll one additional attack die when fighting or shooting (if it has a one-handed ranged weapon in each hand). Cannot be combined with using a two-handed weapon. *(This cost often applies to taking a second weapon in warband creation.)*
- **Fire** *(4 pts)* – The weapon’s attacks set the target on fire. A model wounded by this weapon gains the **Burning** status effect. (Burning causes additional damage at the start of its turn until extinguished; see Status Effects below.) Common on fire-based attacks like alchemical fire or magical flames.
- **First Strike** *(3 pts)* – In the first round of a close combat, a weapon with First Strike gives its wielder an edge. The model gets to roll its attack before an enemy without First Strike can retaliate (you might resolve an exchange in order of First Strike initiative). Mechanically, you might allow a free attack at the very start of a combat or a hit bonus. This rule is typically for weapons like spears, lances that hit as they charge.
- **Fusillade** *(5 pts)* – This weapon can unleash multiple shots quickly. If the model does not move this activation, it can perform two Shoot actions with this weapon instead of one (basically rapid firing). Alternatively, it might allow re-rolling one or two attack dice when shooting due to volume of fire. (Consult specific weapon, e.g., repeater crossbow might have Fusillade.)
- **Heavy** *(-)* – A heavy weapon is cumbersome. It often requires two hands (**Two-Handed** rule) and/or might prevent quick movement. In Grimheim, “Heavy” might mean you cannot move and shoot in the same activation or suffer HTV penalty when moving. (Not explicitly listed here with a cost; it might be just a trait that balances strong weapons.)
- **Piercing** *(7 pts)* – (Not to be confused with Armor Piercing above.) Piercing in some contexts might refer to a type of damage that ignores some defenses. If distinct, perhaps it means the attack ignores the target’s cover benefit or automatic saves. It could also be a keyword for combining with something like Versatile Quiver (see faction rules).
- **Poison** *(6 pts)* – A poisoned weapon delivers toxins. A model that suffers any wound from this weapon gains the **Poisoned** status effect. (Poisoned causes the model to take additional 1 Fatal wound at the end of each turn until cured, representing ongoing damage.)
- **Splash** *(7 pts)* – The attack splashes or arcs to nearby targets (different from Blast which is an area explosion). Splash might allow the attack to hit one additional target adjacent to the primary target (like cleaving through to another enemy, or a flame gout hitting two targets in line). Each target would be hit separately (roll to hit each).
- **Two-Handed** *(-3 pts)* – This weapon requires two hands to use. A model using a two-handed weapon cannot use a second weapon or a shield at the same time in combat. The benefit is that two-handed weapons tend to have higher damage. This trait actually **reduces** the cost of the weapon (since it’s a drawback) by 3 points. *(E.g., a greatsword might have Two-Handed, making it cheaper than two one-handed weapons of similar power.)*

*(As with model rules, more weapon special rules exist in the full game. The above are some key examples. Specific weapons list which of these rules they have in the Weapons reference.)*

## Status Effects

Status effects are temporary conditions that can affect models due to attacks, spells, or environmental hazards. These are not bought with points but occur during gameplay. A model can be affected by multiple different status effects at once, but the same effect does not stack twice. Status effects can often be removed by certain actions (noted for each effect).

- **Stunned:** *Removal:* Can be removed by a **Recover** action (by the affected model) or **Cleanse** (by an ally).  
  *Effect:* The model is dazed and barely responsive. A Stunned model can **only** perform Recover, Cleanse (if it has that ability), or Pass on its activation – it cannot move or attack until it recovers. Stunned often occurs from severe falls or specific critical hits.
- **Burning:** *Removal:* **Recover** or **Cleanse** can put out the flames.  
  *Effect:* The model is on fire. At the **start of each of its turns**, it immediately suffers **D3 Fatal damage** (1–3 wounds ignoring saves). The fire continues each turn until extinguished.
- **Frozen:** *Removal:* **Recover** or **Cleanse**.  
  *Effect:* The model is frozen in ice or numbed by cold. A Frozen model has its MOV reduced by 2 (it’s very slow) and likely cannot perform certain actions (GM discretion; often treated similar to Stunned where movement and attacks are impaired). At minimum, Frozen significantly hampers movement.
- **Fearful:** *Removal:* **Recover** or **Cleanse**.  
  *Effect:* The model is shaken by terror. It suffers a -1 penalty to all hit rolls until the end of its next activation. (Increase its required HTV by +1.) Essentially, it’s less effective at fighting due to fear.
- **Enraged:** *Removal:* **Recover** or **Cleanse**.  
  *Effect:* The model is filled with uncontrollable rage. This might force the model to charge the nearest enemy or prevent it from using certain actions (like it may not hide or fall back). In Grimheim, being Enraged likely means the model *must* spend its actions to move toward and fight the enemy if possible. (Exact rule can be agreed, but common interpretation: cannot use actions except Move/Charge/Fight towards enemy.)
- **Poisoned:** *Removal:* **Heal** action (performed by a model with medical or magical healing) or **Cleanse**.  
  *Effect:* The model is weakened by poison. At the **end of each turn**, a Poisoned model suffers 1 Fatal wound. Poison remains until cured, so each turn it will take another wound. Additionally, a poisoned model might have disadvantage on some tasks (GM can impose -1 to some rolls if appropriate).
- **Cursed:** *Removal:* **Cleanse** only.  
  *Effect:* The model is under a malign curse. While Cursed, whenever the model rolls a **1** on any dice roll for an action (attack, defense, etc.), it immediately suffers 1 Fatal wound (the curse bites them for their failure). The curse persists until cleansed by a holy ability or item.

If a model is **Healed to full health** (100% WND) by a healing ability, certain long-term effects like injuries can be removed (noted as "heal 100%"). For example, Head/Arm/Leg injuries from the injury table require the model to be fully healed to get rid of the penalty.

Understanding and managing status effects is crucial. Use the **Recover** action on your turn if your model is Stunned or suffering an effect that hampers it severely. Allies with **Cleanse** or healing abilities are very useful to purge poisons, curses, or ongoing fire.

Always keep track of which models are affected by what status. The effects typically last until end of turn or until the model takes the specified action to remove them. Plan accordingly – for instance, a Fearful model might want to hang back until its fear subsides if possible, and a Burning model should probably spend AP to Recover as soon as it can (unless you think it can finish a fight before burning to ash).
