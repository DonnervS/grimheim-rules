Below is a list of standard weapons available in Grimheim, divided into close combat (melee) weapons and ranged weapons. Each weapon entry lists its statistics and any inherent special rules. Weapon point costs are included for warband building.

**Stat abbreviations:** RNG = Range, ATK = Attack dice, HTV = Hit value, DMG = normal damage, CRT = critical hit damage, Pts = point cost.

## Close Combat Weapons

- **Improvised Weapon** – *RNG:* 1″, *ATK:* D2, *HTV:* 5+, *DMG:* 1, *CRT:* 2, *Special:* – , *Pts:* 0  
  *(Anything at hand – fists, clubs, rocks. Extremely basic; every model is assumed to have at least this if they have no other weapon.)*

- **Sword** – *RNG:* 1″, *ATK:* 3, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 3, *Special:* – , *Pts:* 10  
  *(A balanced one-handed melee weapon. No special properties, decent accuracy.)*

- **Axe** – *RNG:* 1″, *ATK:* 3, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 3, *Special:* – , *Pts:* 9  
  *(A one-handed axe or hand weapon. Similar to sword; often flavor differences.)*

- **Greataxe** – *RNG:* 1″, *ATK:* 4, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 4, *Special:* Two-Handed, Armor Piercing, Brutal, *Pts:* 22  
  *(A large two-handed axe. Two-Handed: can’t be used with off-hand or shield. Armor Piercing: makes enemy saves harder. “Brutal” might indicate high crit damage which is reflected in CRT 4.)*

- **Two-Handed Hammer** – *RNG:* 1″, *ATK:* 2, *HTV:* 3+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 4, *Special:* Two-Handed, Armor Shatter, *Pts:* 26  
  *(A massive warhammer. Easier to hit (3+ HTV) due to crushing force, and criticals can shatter armor. Requires two hands.)*

- **Warhammer** – *RNG:* 1″, *ATK:* 3, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 3, *Special:* – , *Pts:* 19  
  *(One-handed hammer or mace. Solid damage and reliable.)*

- **Lance** – *RNG:* 1″, *ATK:* 3, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 3, *Special:* First Strike (on charge), Two-Handed, *Pts:* 19  
  *(A spear or lance for mounted charges. Best when charging: often gets to strike first due to First Strike.)*

- **Halberd** – *RNG:* 2″, *ATK:* 3, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 3, *Special:* Two-Handed, Reach, *Pts:* 14  
  *(A polearm with reach. Range 2″ lets you fight from behind another model or strike an enemy 2″ away. Two-Handed weapon.)*

- **Morning Star** – *RNG:* 1″, *ATK:* 3, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 3, *Special:* *Crushing* (critical hits inflict Fatal?), *Pts:* 16  
  *(A spiked flail. Possibly has a chance to ignore shields or cause higher damage on crit. Shown here with moderate stats.)*

- **Scythe** – *RNG:* 2″, *ATK:* 3, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 2, *Special:* Two-Handed, Splash, *Pts:* 17  
  *(An improvised pole weapon (like a reaper’s scythe). It has long reach (2″) and can sweep across multiple foes (Splash allows hitting two adjacent enemies on a swing). Lower critical damage but good for crowd control.)*

- **Claws/Fangs** – *RNG:* 1″, *ATK:* 2, *HTV:* 5+, *DMG:* 1, *CRT:* 2, *Special:* Dual Wield (if two claws), *Pts:* 5  
  *(Natural weapons of beasts (warhounds, etc.). Often come in pairs. Low damage, but often these creatures have Furious or Group to make up for it.)*

*(Additional melee weapons like daggers, greatswords, etc., would follow similar format. In general, two-handed weapons have higher damage or ATK but come with Two-Handed drawback, while one-handed can be paired with shields or dual-wield.)*

## Ranged Weapons

- **Pistol** – *RNG:* 6″, *ATK:* 2, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 3, *Special:* Reload, Close-Quarters, *Pts:* 12  
  *(Early firearm or hand gun. Powerful short range. **Reload:** After firing, it must spend an action to Reload before it can fire again. **Close-Quarters:** Can be used in melee range without penalty (pistols can be fired point-blank or used as a club).)*

- **Handgun (Musket)** – *RNG:* 10″, *ATK:* 3, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 3, *Special:* Reload, *Pts:* 19  
  *(A two-handed firearm with decent range. Packs a punch but requires reloading after each shot.)*

- **Crossbow** – *RNG:* 12″, *ATK:* 2, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 3, *Special:* Reload, Piercing, *Pts:* 15  
  *(A crossbow has good range and hitting power. Needs an action to reload. Often pierces armor well – here represented by a possible slight Armor Piercing effect or just good damage.)*

- **Bow** – *RNG:* 12″, *ATK:* 2, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 1, *CRT:* 2, *Special:* – , *Pts:* 10  
  *(A simple bow. Can shoot every turn without reloading. Lower damage, but reliable rate of fire.)*

  *(A handful of light knives or shuriken. You can throw multiple at once. Fusillade: you may perform two Shoots with knives if you didn’t move, or simply treat as 3 dice low-accuracy attack.)*

- **Repeater Crossbow** – *RNG:* 12″, *ATK:* 3, *HTV:* 4+, *DMG:* 1, *CRT:* 2, *Special:* Fusillade, *Pts:* 20  
  *(A crossbow with a magazine. Can fire multiple weaker shots without reloading. Fusillade here means it can shoot twice per activation or simply has higher ROF but lower damage.)*

- **Blunderbuss** – *RNG:* 8″ (cone), *ATK:* 1 (area), *HTV:* 3+*, *DMG:* 2, *CRT:* 2, *Special:* Blast (spread shot), Reload, *Pts:* 15  
  *(A shotgun-like firearm. Fires a cone of shrapnel. Use Blast: it hits all models in a small cone template or within 2″ of target point. Only one attack die but if it hits, all in area take the hit. Reload after each shot.)*

- **Sniper Rifle** – *RNG:* 24″, *ATK:* 1, *HTV:* 3+, *DMG:* 3, *CRT:* 5, *Special:* Reload, Deadly, *Pts:* 30  
  *(A very long-range rifle or enchanted bow. Very accurate and high damage on a hit (3+ to hit, big damage). Deadly: critical hits from this weapon might be Fatal or ignore armor. Requires reload after shot.)*

- **Flamethrower** – *RNG:* 8″ (template), *ATK:* 1 (area), *HTV:* 3+, *DMG:* 3, *CRT:* 3, *Special:* Fire, Blast (flame template), Reload, *Pts:* 25  
  *(Projects a cone of fire. Any model in the flame template must defend or take 3 damage. Also inflicts Burning on those hit. Requires reload/fuel cooldown per use.)*

*(The above covers common weapons. Each faction might have some unique weapons not listed here, which would be described in the faction rules if applicable.)*

**Note on Special Rules:** Many weapons have special rules listed. Refer to the **Special Rules** reference for details on what those rules do (e.g., Reload means spending an action to ready the weapon again; Armor Piercing makes it harder to save; etc.).

When building your warband, equip your models according to their role – give heavy melee weapons to your strong fighters (but remember two-handed weapons prevent shields), and give ranged weapons to those with good line of sight positions. A model can typically carry one or two weapons: either two one-handed weapons (which could be one melee and one pistol, or two melee for dual-wield), or one two-handed weapon, or one weapon and a shield.

Weapons marked as *Faction-specific* in faction lists are usually only available to that faction’s models (for example, an elf might have an Elven Longbow with slightly different stats, or a dwarf engineer might carry a unique rune gun).

Use the above profiles as a guideline for standard armaments in Grimheim.
