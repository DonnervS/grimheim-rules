# Campaign Rules

Campaigns transform Grimheim from individual skirmishes into an evolving narrative where your warband grows, suffers setbacks, and forges its legend across multiple linked battles. Grimheim offers two campaign formats: Simple Campaigns for flexible narrative play and Conquest Campaigns for territorial warfare.

## Core Campaign Rules

The following rules apply to both Simple and Conquest Campaigns:

### Starting Resources

Before beginning a campaign, players agree on a common Points value for initial warband creation. In campaign mode, Points and Gold use a unified system: every Point spent on models or equipment equals 1 Gold in value. This dual currency connects warband construction with campaign economy, meaning your starting warband's point cost becomes your initial investment in the campaign.

### Build Your Warband

Create your starting warband within the agreed point limit, remembering that each point spent represents Gold invested. Models recruited mid-campaign follow the same principle: their point value equals their Gold cost.

See Building a Warband on page 13 for complete warband construction rules, faction options, and model costs.

### Victory Rewards

After each mission, Victory Points (VP) earned convert to Gold at a fixed rate of 20 Gold per VP. This currency becomes your primary resource for warband development between battles.

Conquest Campaigns also award Conquest Points (CP) for territorial conquest, which determine campaign victory separately from Gold earnings.

##### Spend Gold to:

- Recruit new models at their point value cost
- Purchase equipment and upgrades
- Heal injuries at the Hub's various locations
- Access faction-specific services and training

### Side Quests

Optional objectives that can be undertaken during missions for additional Victory Points and narrative depth.

### After Battle Sequence

Between missions, your warband determines lasting consequences.

1.  Determine lasting consequences - Roll on injury tables for defeated or seriously wounded models
2.  Heal and recover - Restore wounds and remove temporary effects
3.  Visit the Hub - The warband returns to its faction's Hub to spend earned Gold on new models, upgrades, or special benefits

### Campaign End

- Simple Campaign: The campaign concludes after completing the agreed number of missions (typically 3-6 battles). The player with the highest total Victory Points across all missions claims ultimate victory.
- Conquest Campaign: The campaign ends when one player captures the Enemy Stronghold (immediate victory) OR when both players agree to conclude, with the highest Conquest Points determining the winner.

### Campaign Legacy

A campaign's end need not mean your warband's story concludes. Veteran warbands may continue into new campaigns with their accumulated experience, equipment, and battle-hardened warriors, creating ongoing narratives spanning multiple campaign arcs.

Alternatively, successful warbands can retire with honor, their legends told in the taverns and halls of Grimheim while you begin fresh with a new warband and new challenges.

### Traits Limit

Additional Traits can only be gained during a Campaign if the total of 5 is not exceeded.

### Campaign Types

The key difference between Simple and Conquest Campaigns lies in their structure and victory conditions:

#### Simple Campaign

A Simple Campaign links several missions into a continuous narrative with flexible mission selection and straightforward victory tracking.

##### Campaign Structure:

- Choose a series of agreed-upon linked missions played sequentially
- Players agree on which missions to play before each battle
- Consequences carry forward between battles (injuries, gained equipment, warband changes

##### Victory Conditions:

- The campaign concludes after the agreed number of missions
- The player whose warband holds the most total Victory Points is declared the winner

##### Multiplayer Support:

Simple Campaigns support multiple players. Each player faces every other player once in a round-robin format. Track Victory Points across all battles, the player with the highest total VP at campaign's end wins. All players develop their warbands simultaneously using Gold earned from their respective missions.

Best For: Flexible narrative campaigns, multiplayer tournaments, casual ongoing play.

#### Conquest Campaign

A Conquest Campaign simulates territorial warfare with a dynamic back-and-forth struggle for control of Grimheim. Two warbands fight through escalating zones, from Neutral Grounds through Enemy Territory, with the ultimate goal of capturing and destroying the enemy's Stronghold.

##### Campaign Structure:

- Territorial Progression through five zones:  
  Your Stronghold \< Your Territory \< Neutral Grounds \> Enemy Territory \> Enemy Stronghold
- Victory pushes into enemy territory; defeat forces retreat toward your own Stronghold
- Defenders gain powerful bonuses when fighting on home ground
- Each player selects one Stronghold Mission (faction-tagged) and three Territory Missions before the campaign begins
- Conquest Points (CP):  
  In addition to Victory Points, Conquest Campaigns award Conquest Points to track how well you fare during the Campaign

##### Victory Conditions:

- Capture and destroy the Enemy Stronghold for immediate victory, OR  
  Highest Conquest Points when both players agree to conclude

Best For: Epic two-player campaigns with dramatic escalation and territorial conquest

### Conquest Campaign Rules

The following rules describe the territorial system, mission selection, defender bonuses, and victory conditions unique to Conquest Campaigns.

![](media/image/3.png)

### Territorial System

Zone Descriptions:

##### Your Stronghold / Enemy Stronghold

- The ultimate defensive position and seat of power
- Heavily fortified with powerful defender bonuses
- Falling here means campaign defeat
- Accessed only after pushing through all previous zones
- You are always the Defender in your Stronghold and the Attacker in the Enemy Stronghold

##### Your Territory / Enemy Territory

- Home ground with moderate defender advantages
- Contains three missions chosen by the defending player before campaign starts
- Attacker selects which mission to play when this zone is contested
- You are always the Defender in your Territory and the Attacker in the Enemy Territory

##### Neutral Grounds

- The starting point of every Conquest Campaign
- No defender bonuses (balanced combat)
- Roll-off to determine Attacker/Defender
- Contains three missions played in sequence on repeated visits
- Campaigns always reset here after a defender successfully repels an attack

### Conquest Points (CP)

In addition to Victory Points (which convert to Gold for warband development), Conquest Campaigns award Conquest Points to track territorial conquest and determine overall campaign victory.

| Zone            | Attacker Wins | Defender Wins |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Neutral Grounds | 3 CP          | 3 CP          |
| Territory       | 5 CP          | 4 CP          |
| Stronghold      | Total Win     | 4 CP          |

- Victory Points and Conquest Points are tracked separately

### Campaign Flow

All Conquest Campaigns begin at Neutral Grounds.

The territorial progression follows this sequence:

Your Stronghold \< Your Territory \< Neutral Grounds \> Enemy Territory \> Enemy Stronghold

##### After each Battle:

- Award Conquest Points to the winner
- Determine territorial movement:

1.  Win: Proceed one zone toward enemy Stronghold
2.  Lose: Retreat one zone toward own Stronghold
    - Conduct After Battle Sequence
    - Set up next Mission

### Mission Selection

Before the campaign begins, players pre-select their mission pools based on mission tags:

##### Neutral Grounds Missions

Before starting the campaign, both players agree on 3 missions tagged as Base to form the Neutral Grounds pool. These missions are played in rotation on each visit to Neutral Grounds.

Example Neutral Grounds Pool:

- Encounter
- Border Skirmish
- Crossroads Clash

If the campaign returns to Neutral Grounds multiple times, cycle through these missions in sequence.

##### Territory Missions

Each player pre-selects 3 missions tagged as Territory for their own Territory. Record these selections before the campaign begins.

When a Territory is contested, the Attacker chooses which of the defender's 3 Territory missions to play.

Exception: If the Defender successfully defends their Stronghold and pushes back to their Territory, the Defender chooses which Territory mission to play (not the Attacker)

See the Missions chapter for all missions tagged as Territory.

##### Stronghold Missions

Each player pre-selects one mission tagged as Stronghold for their final defensive stand.

When a Stronghold is attacked, the Defender uses their chosen Stronghold mission.

See the Missions chapter for all missions tagged as Stronghold.

### Defender Bonuses

As a Defender, you may select from the Defender Bonus List.

- A Defender Bonus may be selected twice unless stated otherwise.

| Zone            | Defender Bonus |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Neutral Grounds | none           |
| Territory       | 0 - 2          |
| Stronghold      | 2              |

Before a Stronghold Mission is played, the Defender selects two Defender Bonuses from the Defender Bonus List.

Before a Territory Mission is selected, the Defender assigns Defender Bonus values to their three chosen Territory Missions. These values are assigned in secret and represent how many Defender Bonuses will be available if that mission is played.

- One Territory Mission is assigned a value of 2
- One is assigned a value of 1
- One is assigned a value of 0

After the Attacker has chosen the Territory Mission, the Defender reveals the assigned value for that mission and selects that many Defender Bonuses from the Defender Bonus List.

## After Battle Sequence

Between missions during a Campaign play, warbands return to their Camp in the Grimheim Hub to recover, resupply and prepare for the next battle. The After Battle Sequence follows these steps:

### Lasting Consequences

All models that were Defeated or remain Injured at the end of the mission must roll on the appropriate table below to determine their fate.

#### Defeated Models

When a model was Defeated during the mission, roll a D6 and consult the table:

| D6 | Result | Effect |
|----|----|----|
| 1 | Dead | The model is permanently removed from your warband. |
| 2-4 | Permanent Wound | Roll on the Permanent Wounds table. |
| 5 | Healed | The model has recovered fully with no lasting effects. |
| 6 | Survivor | The model has recovered. Roll on the Survivor table for a bonus trait. |

#### Injured Models

When a model ended the mission with one or more Critical Injuries but was not Defeated, roll a D6:

| D6 | Result | Effect |
|----|----|----|
| 1-4 | Permanent Wound | The injury persists. |
| 5 | Healed | The model has recovered fully with no lasting effects. |
| 6 | Survivor | The model has recovered. Roll on the Survivor table for a bonus trait. |

#### Permanent Wounds Table

Models that suffer Permanent Wounds gain lasting penalties. Roll a D3:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col"><p>D3</p></th>
<th scope="col"><p>Result</p></th>
<th scope="col"><p>Effect</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>1</p></td>
<td><p>Head</p></td>
<td><p>HTV +1<br />
(Harder to hit enemies)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>2</p></td>
<td><p>Arm</p></td>
<td><p>ATK -1<br />
(Fewer attack dice)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>3</p></td>
<td><p>Leg</p></td>
<td><p>MOV -1<br />
(Reduced movement)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

A model may accumulate multiple Permanent Wounds over the course of a campaign. Track these on the model's card or in the Grimheim Companion.

##### Healer

Permanent Wounds can be removed by a Healer in the Hub.

#### Survivor Table

Models that beat the odds gain experience from their near-death encounter. Roll a D6:

| D6 | Result | Effect |
|----|----|----|
| 1 | Swift | MOV +1 |
| 2 | Stalwart | DEF +1 |
| 3 | Onslaught | ATK +1 for one weapon of your choice |
| 4 | Expertise | HTV -1 for one weapon of your choice |
| 5-6 | Veteran | Gain the Veteran trait (May re-roll one failed Attack or Defense die per turn) |

Survivor bonuses are permanent and remain with the model for the rest of the campaign.

## Visit the Hub

After determining the fate of all casualties, players may spend their earned Gold to visit various locations in their Camp at the Grimheim Hub. Each model may visit one location during the After Battle Sequence.

##### Gold Earned:

Convert Victory Points earned during the mission to Gold at a rate of 20 Gold per VP.

Gold serves as the campaign’s core resource:

- Recruit new models
- Upgrade models
- Recover from lasting injuries
- Unlock faction-based bonuses

##### Equipment

A player may sell any Equipment that has been looted during a Mission for its corresponding Gold value.

##### Underdog Bonus:

Whenever a player has received 5 VP less than any other player in the previous Mission, that player receives a discount of 25% (rounded up) on all services in the Grimheim Hub. The discounted value is shown in brackets.

### Hub Locations

#### Standard Locations

Some locations like the Healer and Tavern are always available in your camp and accessible to all factions.

Trainers teach Traits that enhance a model's capabilities. A complete list of all available Traits and their effects can be found on page XX.

Newly learned Traits are permanent and count toward a model's maximum of 5 Traits. A model cannot learn a Trait it already possesses or exceed the 5 Trait limit.

Each available Trainer may train only one model per warband during the After Battle Sequence. If multiple trainers are available, different models may be trained by different trainers.

- Example: If both the Marksman and Old Sage are available (rolled a 6), one model may learn a trait from the Marksman and a different model may learn a trait from the Old Sage.
