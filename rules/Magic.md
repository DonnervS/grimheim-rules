Magic in Grimheim is represented by Arcane spells, divine prayers, and other supernatural abilities. Not every warband will have access to magic – only models with the **Arcane** or **Priest** special rules can cast spells or perform prayers. Magic can turn the tide of battle with powerful effects, but it relies on the fickle winds of Magical Energy.

## Magical Energy and Spellcasting

To cast a spell, a model must use the **Cast a Spell** special action (which costs 1 AP and requires the model to have the *Arcane* special rule). When casting, the model **generates Magical Energy (ME)** by rolling 2D6. The total rolled is the amount of energy available for that spell attempt.

- After rolling for ME, the caster may choose one spell from their available **Arcane Lore** to attempt. Each spell has a required energy cost. If the generated ME total is equal to or greater than the spell’s cost, the spell is successfully cast. If it’s lower, the spell fails (and nothing happens, though the AP is still spent).
- **Magical Mishaps:** Magic is risky. If the casting roll comes up **snake eyes** (a roll of 1 and 1 on the 2D6), the attempt backfires disastrously. The caster suffers **2 Fatal damage** (which cannot be saved) as magical feedback. This is in addition to the spell failing.

Models with the **Priest** special rule can perform **prayers** using the **Prayer** action (1 AP). Prayers do not require rolling for magical energy – they are assumed to always succeed, but typically prayers have more subtle effects or are limited in range. (The specific effects of prayers would be listed with the model or faction; for example, a prayer might heal an ally or ward off undead within a short range.)

**Arcane Lore:** At warband creation, if you have any Arcane or Priest models, you will choose one Arcane Lore for your warband. This represents the school of magic or divine domain your spellcasters can draw from. Examples of Arcane Lores include **Lesser Magic** (common simple spells), **Elemental Magic** (command of fire, ice, etc.), or **Divine Blessing** (holy miracles). Each lore provides a list of spells that those models can cast.

> *Note:* All factions have access to **Lesser Magic** as a baseline lore, and often one or two unique lores. For instance, an Imperial warband might choose between Elemental Magic or Divine Blessings, while an Undead warband might have access to Necromancy. Mercenaries are limited to **Lesser Magic** only. Choosing a lore does **not** cost additional points.

## Spells (Lesser Magic)

Below is the list of spells from the **Lesser Magic** lore, which is the basic set of spells accessible to most factions. (Other Arcane Lores would have their own spell lists, but those are detailed in faction-specific rules.)

- **Fog of War** – *Cost: 3 ME.* **Effect:** Shrouds an ally in mist. Target a friendly model within 12″. That model counts as **Hidden** (cannot be targeted by ranged attacks) until the end of its next activation.
- **Teleport** – *Cost: 4 ME.* **Effect:** Instantly move the caster. Place the caster up to 12″ away in a location the caster can see. This move can ignore intervening terrain or models (magical teleportation). If the caster teleports into base contact with an enemy, it counts as having **Charged** that enemy.
- **Fireball** – *Cost: 5 ME.* **Effect:** Hurl a fiery projectile. This is a shooting attack with Range 12″, ATK 3, HTV 4+, DMG 3, CRT 4. It also has the **Fire** special rule (targets set ablaze suffer Burning status). Essentially, roll 3 dice to hit (4+ each); each hit deals 3 damage (4 on a crit). The target can defend normally against this as it would a ranged attack.
- **Healing Touch** – *Cost: 5 ME.* **Effect:** Channel healing energy. The caster (or a touched model within 1″) immediately performs a free **Heal** action (as per the Special Actions list). This typically restores some Wounds (see Heal action under Special Actions).
- **Arcane Barrier** – *Cost: 6 ME.* **Effect:** Protective ward. Target a model (friend or self) within 12″. That model gains **Protected** status until the end of its next turn – meaning the next time it defends, it may automatically convert one defense die into a successful normal save without rolling (similar to cover). Essentially, Arcane Barrier lets the target retain one save die on their next defense.
- **Divine Favor** – *Cost: 9 ME.* **Effect:** Twist fate in your favor. Choose any one model (friend or foe) within 24″. That model must re-roll one upcoming dice roll (or you may re-roll one of your own) – you get to see the initial result and then decide to use Divine Favor to force a re-roll or take a re-roll. The second result stands (cannot be changed by another fate effect). This spell is often used to make an enemy re-roll a successful roll or to retry an important failed roll for your side.

## Magic Scrolls and Items

Some missions or equipment may grant **Magic Scrolls** or similar one-use items. A Magic Scroll typically contains a specific spell that can be cast without needing Arcane skill or energy:

- To use a scroll, a model spends a **Cast a Spell** action, but does *not* need to roll for Magical Energy. The spell on the scroll simply takes effect automatically (no risk of failure or backlash). Scrolls can allow non-mage characters to perform a one-time magical effect.
- Scrolls are consumed upon use (one use only). For example, a **Scroll of Healing** might allow any model to perform the Healing Touch spell once without rolling ME.

## Combining Magic with Fate

Magic attacks (spells) are resolved similarly to other attacks, so Fate Dice can be used to enhance them. For instance, you could use a **Focus** fate die to get +1 on a hit roll for an offensive spell like Fireball, or use a **Replace** die to substitute a high roll for one of your Magical Energy dice if you rolled poorly while casting.

Keep in mind that some fate modifiers or special faction abilities interact with magic – e.g., certain **Arcane Surge** fate abilities might extend spell range, etc. Always consult your faction’s fate modifier rules for possible synergies.

Magic adds a powerful toolset to your warband but must be used wisely. High-cost spells can fail at the crucial moment, and a miscast can harm your own sorcerer. Balance the use of magic with mundane tactics for best results!
