# How to play Grimheim

## General Principle

Grimheim is built to create a fun and fair tactical experience. While the rules aim for clarity, not every situation may be covered. Use common sense, prioritize game flow, and agree with your opponent on unclear cases. If you can’t reach a consensus, perform a Roll-off.

### Roll-off

Each player rolls one D6. The higher result wins. Re-roll on ties.

### Distances and Measurements

Measurements are taken in inches (“) and may be made at any time during the game.

## Model

An individual miniature on the battlefield representing a warrior, creature, or character in your warband. Each model has its own characteristics, weapons, and abilities.

## Game Modes

Grimheim can be played in multiple formats, each offering different levels of depth and progression. Choose the mode that best suits your time and play style.

### Quick Game

Perfect for standalone battles or when you want immediate tactical action without long-term commitment.

#### Setup:

- Set Point Limit: Agree on a common point value for both warbands to ensure balanced gameplay.
- Build Your Warband: Create a custom warband using the Character Builder or select a pre-built Iconic Warband from the faction chapters.
- Choose a Mission: Select a Mission (standard is Encounter) and determine which warbands will face off.
- Victory Condition: Score the most Victory Points through objectives and defeating enemies to claim victory.

Quick Games are ideal for tournaments or casual games. They are designed for 30–60 minutes of fast-paced tactical play.

### Campaign Play

Campaigns transform individual skirmishes into an evolving narrative where your warband grows, suffers setbacks, and forges its legend across multiple linked battles. Grimheim offers two campaign formats:

See the Campaign Rules chapter for complete rules.

### Simple Campaign

A flexible narrative campaign linking several missions with straightforward victory tracking. Players agree on mission sequence, develop their warbands between battles using earned Gold, and track total Victory Points across all missions. The player with the highest VP total at campaign's end wins.

Best For: Flexible narrative campaigns, multiplayer tournaments (supports 3+ players in round-robin format), casual ongoing play

### Conquest Campaign

An epic territorial warfare campaign where two warbands fight for control of Grimheim through a dynamic, shifting battlefield. Push through five escalating zones, from Neutral Grounds to the enemy's Stronghold, with defenders gaining powerful advantages on home ground. Victory pushes into enemy territory; defeat forces retreat. The ultimate goal: capture and destroy the Enemy Stronghold.

Best For: Epic two-player campaigns with dramatic escalation and territorial conquest
