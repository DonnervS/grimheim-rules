The battlefield in Grimheim is filled with terrain features that can impact movement, line of sight, and cover. Players should discuss and agree on what each terrain piece represents and how it functions before the game begins.

## Line of Sight and Visibility

Models have a **360° field of view** – they can see in any direction (you don’t need to face models in a specific direction). When checking **line of sight (LOS)** for a ranged attack or ability, ignore your own friendly models (they do not block LOS). However, terrain and enemy models can block sight.

A target is considered **visible** if the attacker can draw an unobstructed line from the attacker’s head/eyes to the target model, seeing at least a significant portion (about 20%) of the target. If the target model is using a **Hide** action, it is not visible until it is discovered or it activates.

- **Base Size:** For LOS purposes, use the model’s base as a reference for its footprint. Ignore minor protruding bits of a model when determining if at least 20% is visible; the idea is to see a meaningful portion of the model’s body.

**Cover:** If a model is next to terrain that could shield it (e.g., right behind a wall or inside a thicket) and mostly behind that cover from the attacker’s point of view, it is considered in cover. Cover in Grimheim grants a defensive bonus in ranged combat: the defender may retain 1 defense die as an automatic normal save (see **Combat – Ranged Combat** for details). Note which direction the model is taking cover from, as moving around could negate it.

## Terrain Types

Declare the terrain pieces on the board as one of the following types (or a combination, if appropriate) before the game starts. This ensures both players know how each piece will affect gameplay:

- **Open Terrain:** Examples: clear ground, roads, open plains.  
  *Effect:* No special effects – models move normally. Open terrain does not provide cover.

- **Difficult Terrain:** Examples: woods, mud, rubble, shallow swamp.  
  *Effect:* Models can move through but at a penalty. Typically, a model **cannot Run** through difficult terrain (no double-move), and you may choose to impose a -2″ movement penalty when moving through it (if the terrain is dense). Models in difficult terrain might also count as partially obscured for cover, depending on the terrain (decide before game).

- **Blocking Terrain:** Examples: solid walls, buildings, large rock formations.  
  *Effect:* Blocks line of sight completely – you cannot see through blocking terrain. Models cannot move **through** blocking terrain (you must go around or over, by climbing if possible). Provides cover to models hiding behind it.

- **Dangerous Terrain:** Examples: pools of acid, burning ground, quicksand, spiked pits.  
  *Effect:* Models can move through it, but it’s hazardous. A model that moves in or through dangerous terrain suffers **D3 Fatal wounds** for each Move action it spends in that terrain. (Usually, just entering it triggers the damage once per Move.) Dangerous terrain still allows movement but at a deadly cost.

- **Elevated Terrain:** Examples: rooftops, upper floors of a building, towers, lookout platforms (generally at least 3″ above ground level).  
  *Effect:* Being on high ground offers advantages. A model on elevated terrain may perform **Overwatch** and **Take Aim** special actions (see Special Actions) thanks to its vantage point. Elevated positions also often provide clear lines of sight (ignoring intervening low terrain) and can give the shooter an edge (target might be more exposed). Falling or jumping from elevated terrain can cause fall damage as described in movement rules.

## Special Terrain Actions

Some special actions are only available due to terrain:

- **Overwatch** *([Elevated Terrain], 1 AP):* The model sets up a delayed ranged attack from a high vantage. After using Overwatch, the next time an enemy model moves into the model’s weapon range and line of sight (and the model isn’t engaged in melee or hiding at that moment), the Overwatch model can immediately take a Shoot action at that enemy with a +1 penalty to the enemy’s Hit Value (i.e., slightly less accurate due to waiting). This attack interrupts the enemy’s movement (resolve the shot with HTV +1 for the target). Overwatch cannot be used if the model is already in melee, or if it has moved/run/shot already in its activation.

- **Take Aim** *([Elevated Terrain], 1 AP):* The model braces and carefully aims from its perch. The next ranged attack it makes (later in the same turn) gains a bonus of **-1 HTV** (making it easier to hit). Essentially, the attack’s Hit Value requirement is 1 lower than normal. The model cannot be engaged in melee when taking aim.

These actions reflect the benefit of high ground in ranged combat. Only models on terrain designated as *Elevated* can use Overwatch or Take Aim.

## Using Terrain in Play

At the start of the game, the **defending player** (in an attack/defense scenario) or players collaboratively should place terrain and agree on its types. Ensure there is a mix of open areas and covered areas to allow tactical movement and positioning. Typical board setup might include some tall blocking pieces, some difficult terrain patches, and scatter terrain for cover.

Terrain adds tactical depth:
- Use **open terrain** to maneuver quickly.
- Use **cover and blocking terrain** to protect your approach from enemy fire.
- Risk **dangerous terrain** only if the payoff is worth the guaranteed wounds.
- Seize **elevated terrain** for shooting advantages, but beware of being isolated or knocked down from heights.

By understanding terrain and using it wisely, you can control engagement ranges and protect your models, or force your opponent into disadvantageous positions.
