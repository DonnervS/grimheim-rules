# Custom Character Builder

The Custom Character Builder lets you design unique models for Grimheim by combining stats, equipment, and special abilities.

Follow the steps below to assemble your model.

1.  Faction  
    Your model’s faction is determined by the warband it belongs to.  
    The chosen faction grants access to its specific Fate Modifiers and Arcane or Divine Lores.
2.  Body Type  
    Select a Body Type to set your model’s base stats: AP, MOV, DEF, WND, and starting Traits.  
    Some Body Types are exclusive to certain factions. See the relevant faction chapter for the full list.
3.  Tier  
    Choose the Tier to determine whether the model is a standard fighter or an exceptional unit with improved stats and Traits.  
    If the model is part of a cross-faction warband, it must take the Mercenary Trait entry. This increases the cost by 5 points and uses one Trait slot.
4.  Armor  
    Select an Armor type. Armor determines the model’s SAV (Save) value and may grant additional Traits.
5.  Traits  
    Define the Class of a model by adding Traits.
6.  Weapons  
    Equip up to two weapons. Weapon profiles define their range, attack values, and Traits.
7.  Equipment  
    Optionally, add Equipment to enhance your model. Equipment provides Traits and can be found in missions or acquired during a campaign.

### Traits Limit

A model can have no more than 5 Traits in total!

## Faction

### Faction-specific Entries

The entries listed in this section are a reduced selection intended for quick or simplified games. Each faction offers a much broader range of options, including unique entries not shown here.For the complete list of available faction-specific choices, refer to the relevant faction chapter.

Some Body types are only available to certain factions, as listed in the individual factions chapter.

## Tier

A model can be a standard unit or it can be an exquisite fighter, like a Leader or a Hero. These models get a bonus to their stats. You have to choose a Tier level for each model.

A model can also have multiple Tier levels that add up.

Only one model of the warband can be selected as Leader and receives the leader Trait. It is not required to include a Leader or Hero in your warband.

Up to two models can select the Hero tier.

Up to 5 models can be Veterans.

Faction:

Imperial

Sol invictus, vita aeterna.  
The Flame That Never Falters

  
A fractured giant built upon the bones of fallen empires, the Imperium is more than a nation—it is an idea made manifest in stone, fire, and doctrine. Rooted in the twin legacies of Roman order and Germanic resilience, it spans a dozen electorates, each clinging to its own ancient identity. Together, they uphold a brittle unity beneath the gaze of Sol Invictus—the Unconquered Sun—whose divine light justifies the rule of emperors and inquisitors alike.  
  
Within this sprawling dominion, tradition is both shield and shackle. The Imperium defends stability, hierarchy, and the sacred flame of continuity, even as resentment smolders in its borderlands. From the shadowed halls of the Alpinewacht to the restless steppes of the Ostmark, its subjects live under a banner of glory and fear.  
  
Yet cracks are forming. The bureaucracy festers. The old nobility wars with reformers, and foreign faiths stir unrest among the lower castes. Still, the Imperium endures—grim, defiant, and eternal.  
  
Wherever the light of Sol Invictus falls, the Imperium follows.

## Introduction

This chapter expands upon the Game Rules and the Custom Character Builder by presenting the unique identities of Grimheim’s factions.

Each faction not only offers distinct flavor through specialized Body Types, Traits, and Weapons, but also provides exclusive Fate Modifiers that define powerful subfactions and alter the flow of battle. Factions with magical traditions also have access to their own Arcane or Divine Lores, granting unique spells or invocations unavailable to others.

For players who want to dive straight into the action, you will also find iconic warbands with ready-to-play custom models. These warbands can be deployed immediately or used as inspiration and a foundation for building your own unique force.

A warband composed entirely of models from a single faction may use all of that faction’s advantages—its exclusive Fate Modifiers, special Lores, and faction-specific rules—allowing you to fully embrace its strengths and theme. Mixed warbands sacrifice some of these benefits for greater flexibility in model choice.

## Faction Perks & Playstyles

The Imperial forces embody discipline, resilience, and coordinated tactics. Their warriors often wear reliable armor and fight in tight formation, blending ranged support with solid melee lines.

- Strengths: Balanced forces with access to both defensive and offensive Fate Modifiers; reliable armor and shields; strong leadership abilities.
- Playstyle: Excels in methodical advances and holding objectives, using commanders and support units to adapt to changing threats.
- When to play them: Ideal for players who enjoy a tactical, combined-arms approach and value a dependable game plan over chaotic swings of fortune.

Witchhunters

Faith is fire.

Doubt is heresy.

  
They are not soldiers, though they bear arms.  
They are not priests, though they speak for the flame.  
They are judgment given flesh.

The Witch Hunters are the relentless hounds of the Sol Invictus Cult—an autonomous order of interrogators, trackers, and executioners tasked with rooting out sorcery, heresy, and corruption wherever the sun‘s light does not reach. Operating beyond the reach of local law, they answer only to the Black Cardinals and the sacred flame itself.

Clad in scorched leathers and iron sigils, they move from town to town like stormclouds, feared even by the faithful. Where they pass, whispers die and secrets ignite. They use blessed relics, alchemical fire, and sanctioned torture without hesitation. To them, mercy is just another form of cowardice.

But within their ranks are many kinds: fanatics and broken men, idealists and true believers, or those who hunt the witch because they once loved one. Each carries a brand—not of shame, but of purpose. They do not seek redemption. They deliver it.

Sisters of   
Radiance

The sun does not yield,  
and neither shall we.

  
The Sisters of Radiance are a militant order of women sworn to Sol Invictus, devoted to embodying his light not through words alone but through steel, discipline, and sacrifice. Clad in simple robes reinforced with plate, bearing hammers and burning icons, they are both guardians and zealots, feared for their resolve as much as for their faith.  
  
They dwell in fortified convents within the Imperium, places that serve as both sanctuary and training ground. Here, recruits are forged in body and spirit—taught to master the art of war, the discipline of doctrine, and the burden of mercy. Unlike the priesthood or the witch hunters, the Sisters claim no authority in law or judgment. Instead, they see themselves as the shield of the innocent and the blade of the righteous.  
  
Yet their fervor is not without shadows. Some see in them uncompromising zeal that blinds as much as it guides, others a necessary counterbalance to the corruption of priests and the cruelty of inquisitors. To the Sisters themselves, such doubts mean nothing. Their creed is clear: where darkness spreads, they bring the fire.

Iconic Warband:

Sky Wardens

Those Who Chose the Light

  
The Sky Wardens are not a formal order, nor were they ever meant to exist. They are a gathered remnant, a band of the cast aside and the condemned, bound together not by rank or blood, but by belief. At their head stands an exiled Solar Knight of Sol Invictus, stripped of title and honor, yet not of faith. Where the Imperium turned its back, the light did not.

Around him has formed a strange fellowship. Rebels who would not bend. Outcasts cast down by law or dogma. Soldiers who saw too much and refused to forget. They are accompanied by a priestess of Sol Invictus, a voice of ritual and conscience, who believes that the light must be carried to those it has abandoned. Together, they have sworn themselves not to the Imperium as it is, but to what it claims to be.

The Sky Wardens fight with scavenged gear, salvaged armor, and weapons of many origins. Discipline exists, but it is forged through trust rather than command. Each member knows they are replaceable, but the cause is not. In battle they strike hard and fast, favoring movement, elevation, and sudden intervention. They do not hold ground. They arrive, change the course of fate, and vanish again.

To the Imperium, the Sky Wardens are an uncomfortable truth. They are loyal, yet uncontrolled. Faithful, yet disobedient. Some call them heretics in waiting. Others see them as proof that the light still inspires those the state has failed.

To the Sky Wardens themselves, none of this matters. They believe the light is not granted by office, nor revoked by exile. It is chosen.

Faction:

Primordial

That Which Was Before

  
Before the first temple was raised, before the first crown was forged, before even the gods were named, there were the Primordials. They are not deities in the way mortals understand divinity, but the raw truths of existence—rage, change, excess, and life itself—given form. They are the tides beneath all tides, the storm before the wind, the fire before the flame.  
  
To some, they are chaos incarnate; to others, they are the truest order the world has ever known. Their followers—shamans, prophets, and warlords—seek not to reshape the world, but to return it to the state it was in before the laws of men and gods were written. In their eyes, civilization is a cage, and the Primordials are the keys.  
  
Their worship is older than any scripture and more dangerous than any heresy. There is no single church, no unifying creed—only countless cults and tribes bound by visions, omens, and the pulse of ancient power. Rituals vary from blood sacrifice beneath storm-torn skies to the planting of sacred groves where no axe may ever fall.  
  
The Primordial Forces do not promise mercy or justice. They promise truth, stripped of all illusions. To follow them is to embrace the wild heart of creation, and to risk being consumed by it.
