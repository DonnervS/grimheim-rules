The **Encounter** is a standard skirmish mission, ideal for two players and balanced warbands. It features objective markers to fight over and encourages both combat and positioning.

**Game Area:** Play on a 24″ x 24″ board (2ft by 2ft). This small battlefield ensures quick action.

**Deployment:** Divide the board into halves. Each player’s **deployment zone** is a 6″ deep strip along one board edge. There should be a 12″ neutral gap between the two deployment zones. Determine attacker and defender (roll-off winner chooses). The defender sets up terrain (both players should agree on terrain types and placement), then the attacker chooses which side of the board to deploy on (which side is their zone vs. defender’s zone).
- The defender places the first model in their deployment zone, then players alternate deploying one model at a time until all models are deployed.
- Models must be deployed within their 6″ zone, not outside it.

**Objectives:** Place **D3+2** objective markers on the battlefield. Roll a D3 and add 2 (resulting in 3 to 5 objectives). These objective markers represent strategic points or treasures.
- Objective markers should be placed **outside** of any deployment zone (no starting right next to one) and at least 8″ apart from each other.
- If players can’t agree on placement, take turns placing objectives until the required number are on the board.
- These can be physical markers like coins, stones, etc., about 1″ in diameter each.

**Special Actions:** Models can use the **Loot** action on an objective marker if they are in base contact (within 1″) to interact with it. In Encounter, “looting” an objective doesn’t remove it; it’s just the action used to pick up potential items (if using the Equipment table) or to denote control (see Scoring).

**Scoring:** Victory Points are scored at the **end of each turn** for control of objectives and other feats:
- For each objective marker, check which player has **control** at end of turn. A player controls an objective if they have more models within 3″ of it than the enemy, and at least one of their models in range has **line of sight** to the marker (not hiding behind a wall, for instance). 
  - **3 VP** per objective if one player has more models there (“controls” it uncontested by numbers).
  - **2 VP** per objective if both players have the same number of models there (tied control).
  - **1 VP** per objective if you have at least one model there but fewer than the opponent (you have presence but not majority).
- **Kill Points:** Additionally, each turn a player scores **1 VP for each enemy model that was defeated during that turn.** This rewards you for taking out foes continuously.
- **Side Quest:** If you are using Side Quests (optional, as described in Core Rules), and a player completes their secret side quest, they score bonus VP depending on the quest difficulty (commonly 1 to 5 VP as noted on the side quest roll). In the Encounter mission, a guideline is to award VP for side quests as follows: trivial quest ~1 VP, moderate ~3 VP, challenging ~5 VP. (For example, quest result 1:11-13 might be worth 1 VP, 3:21-23 worth 3 VP, 5:31-33 worth 5 VP, as hinted in rulebook).

**Game Length:** The Encounter usually lasts 4 turns. After the end of Turn 4, tally VP. If one player is behind by 5 or more VP and both agree, a Turn 5 “overtime” may be played to give a chance to catch up (as per core rules, Overtime is triggered if one player has 5+ VP less than the other – it’s essentially a mercy rule allowing a comeback attempt).

**Victory:** At game’s end, the player with the higher Victory Point total wins the Encounter. If VP are tied, the game is a draw (or you can use another tiebreaker like total enemy models defeated, if desired).

**Special Rules:** None specific to this mission beyond what’s described. This is a straight fight with objectives. No additional environmental effects or narrative rules.

Both warbands enter the fray with the same goal: control the field and take out the enemy. Use the terrain to your advantage when moving between objectives, and balance your focus between grabbing objectives and eliminating enemy threats. The Encounter mission is balanced to test both strategy and tactics, making it a great default scenario for Grimheim battles.
